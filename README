I am always irritated by naming of files, esp. papers that I read.  In general, I want the filename to contain the author(s) and title.  This can be recorded in the metadata of the PDF, except for most people do not.  I am as guilty as everyone else  There is an abundance of tools to manipulate PDF in Linux, but none allows me to change the title and author in the metadata easily, then rename the file accordingly.  So, I wrote these scripts that uses pdftk and pdfinfo.

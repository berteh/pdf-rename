I am always irritate by naming of files I read.  In general, I want the filename to contain the author and title.  This can be recorded in the metadata of the PDF, except for most people do not.  There is an abundant of tools to manipulate PDF in Linux, but none allow me to change the title and author in the metadata easily, then rename the file accordingly.  So, I wrote these scripts that uses pdftk and pdfinfo.
